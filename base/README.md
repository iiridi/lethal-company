### [v4.4.0] [For Lethal Company v45] High quality modpack containing 80+ quality of life and rebalance mods that improve the gameplay loop while still remaining a challenging experience. Install this modpack if you are looking for an experience that:
- Is ideal for 2-8 players.
- Increases the difficulty of vanilla LC, but not to insane amounts.
- Adds fresh content to the game that stays true to the genre.
- Adds plenty of quality of life additions to streamline your gameplay.
- Recieves frequent updates and tweaks to ensure the best experience.

Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MNVDHjrrkA) to chat with other users of the modpack and find people to play with, as well as being notified whenever an update drops.

Discuss the modpack, suggest features, and report issues on the [GitHub Discussion page](https://github.com/Clark919/TheMostLethalCompany/discussions). I'm often unable to test every aspect of an included mod so reporting issues is useful! Before making a new issue, make sure it isn't already covered, and make sure you've reinstalled the game to the latest update!

### On new version releases, I recommend reinstalling the modpack. Thunderstore fails to remove files that are no longer in a modpack on a profile, which will cause issues for your game.

        - Has 80s of battery life.
        - Links to the ship's radar. So changing the tracked target on the remote will also change it on the ship and vice-versa.
        - Only allows viewing of player's positions. Does not allow the use of terminal commands.
    - Hack Pad (■60), allows the user to connect to turrets, landmines, and bulkheads to hack them, which would perform the same interaction as typing their code into the ship's terminal.

![Entities and Hazards](https://i.imgur.com/BB4ywFM.png)
---
- New/altered entities. I've added them here in a style similar to the bestiary and obfuscated them for those who want to be surprised. If you want to know the details and see some images, reveal away:
---
<details>
<summary>CLICK TO ACCESS FILE ENTITY-01: B■■■■A</summary>

# ENTITY-01: BOOMBA
![Boomba](https://i.imgur.com/Ixvn9nY.png)
> Image captured of a Boomba on crewmate A-03's bodycam.

### SIGURD'S DANGER LEVEL: 20%

### NOTABLE FEATURES:
```
- A ROAMING LANDMINE THAT SEARCHES FOR NEARBY TARGETS AND ATTEMPTS TO DRIVE UNDERNEATH THEM.
- STEPPING ON THEM OR DESTROYING THEM WILL CAUSE THEM TO EXPLODE.
- MOUNTED WITH A FLASHLIGHT. CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR FLASHLIGHTS OF OTHER CREW MEMBERS IN SOME SITUATIONS.
```

#### CAN SEE? YES.
#### CAN HEAR? YES.

### RECOMMENDATION:
```
- BE AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. THEY ARE DECEPTIVELY SMALL AND QUIET AND WILL SNEAK UP ON UNSUSPECTING CREWS.
- CAN BE EASILY OUTMANEUVERED AND DO NOT POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT.
- DO NOT DAMAGE THEM IF YOU WISH TO SURVIVE.
```

# ENTITY-02: MIMIC
![Mimic](https://i.imgur.com/Rx7aVyb.png)
> Last image captured by crewmate A-01 before he was devoured by a Mimic.

### SIGURD'S DANGER LEVEL: 80%

### NOTABLE FEATURES:
```
- WHEN ESCAPE FROM THE FACILITY SEEMS NEAR, THE MIMIC POSES A FINAL THREAT TO SAFETY.
- A CREATURE THAT LURKS IN FIRE ESCAPE DOORS AND WILL INSTANTLY DEVOUR ANY UNSUSPECTING VICTIMS WHO TRY TO PASS THROUGH.
- UNAVOIDABLE AND UNKILLABLE ONCE PROVOKED.
```

#### CAN SEE? NO.
#### CAN HEAR? NO.

### RECOMMENDATION:
```
- CAREFULLY INSPECT ALL FIRE ESCAPE DOORS BEFORE USING THEM. ANY NOTABLE DISCREPANCY CAN SIGNIFY THE PRESENCE OF A MIMIC.
- VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF FIRE ESCAPE DOORS WITH YOUR RESIDENT TERMINAL OPERATOR. IF THEY DO NOT SEE A DOOR, THE DOOR IS NOT REAL.
- ENSURE YOU ONLY TRUST THE DOORS YOU ENTERED THROUGH THE FACILITY WITH, OR HAVE SEEN ANOTHER CREWMATE USE SAFELY.
```

# ENTITY-03: THE MASKED
![Masked](https://i.imgur.com/YexxJKK.png)
> Footage captured of crewmate A-12 from crewmate A-11's bodycam. A-12 exhibited aggressive behaviour and was unresponsive to verbal cues. A-12 still replied in their own voice, but repeated words said previously. Shortly after this still was captured, crewmate A-11 became unresponsive, but their radar remained active.

### SIGURD'S DANGER LEVEL: 70%

### NOTABLE FEATURES:
```
- A TWISTED VERSION OF A FORMER COMPANY EMPLOYEE. A MASK NOTABLY GRAFTED TO THEIR FACE AS WELL AS THEIR TENDANCY TO HUNT OTHER CREWMATES 
SIGNIFIES THEM AS A THREAT.
- ACTS IN A ZOMBIFIED MANNER, AND ATTEMPTS TO GRAB UNINFECTED CREWMATES WHEN CLOSE TO SPREAD THEIR CONDITION.
- LURES TARGETS IN THROUGH THE USE OF WEARING COMPANY CLOTHES AND SPEAKING IN FAMILIAR VOICES.
```

#### CAN SEE? YES.
#### CAN HEAR? YES.

### RECOMMENDATION:
```
- ODD BEHAVIOUR FROM FELLOW CREWMATES, EITHER IN PERSON OR ON THE RADAR, MAY SIGNAL THEIR TURN INTO ONE OF THE MASKED.
- BEHAVIOUR MAY INCLUDE: REPEATED PHRASES FROM ANY CREWMATE'S VOICE, FOLLOWING CREWMATES CLOSELY, OR RAISING ARMS TO GRAPPLE A CREWMATE 
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.
- BE WARY OF REMAINING MASKED EMPLOYEES FROM PREVIOUS EXPEDITIONS WHO MAY LURK ON THE MOON.
```

<details>
<summary>CLICK TO ACCESS FILE HAZ-01: T■■■P■■■■R TRAP</summary>

# HAZARD-01: TELEPORTER TRAP
![Teleporter](https://i.imgur.com/GkC7vf8.png)

### SIGURD'S DANGER LEVEL: 5%

### NOTABLE FEATURES:
```

- THE VICTIM WILL SUFFER NO DAMAGE TO THEMSELVES OR THEIR HELD ITEMS.
```

### RECOMMENDATION:
```
- WATCH THE FLOORS AND BRING A FLASHLIGHT TO SPOT THEM EASIER.
- USE A HACKING TOOL OR ASK YOUR RESIDENT TERMINAL OPERATOR TO DISABLE IT TEMPORARILY OVER RADIO IF THE TRAP IS IMPASSABLE.
- CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO ESCAPE MORE DANGEROUS THREATS IF NECESSARY.
```

</details>

---

---

- Utilities:
    - `UP ARROW` and `DOWN ARROW` will navigate through command history, allowing you to reinput a command if needed.

    - `quit` will force the user out of the terminal screen.
    - `loot` will show the total value of scrap onboard the ship.
    - `fov <value>` will adjust your field of view. Works identical to the chat command.
    - `vitals` will provide a summary of a player's health, carried weight, and sanity, at the cost of ■10.
      - Can be upgraded for ■200 to make the command no longer cost credits.
    - `extend` will extend your quota by one day.
      - Can be used once per quota.
      - Costs the same as the current quota. Can be reduced by upgrading the "Deadline discount" ship perk.
